# Library Management System Project

## 📚 Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a comprehensive database project designed to manage and track all information about books, employees, and customers in a library. This system helps maintain records of books' availability, rental prices, and the status of issued and returned books. It also provides a way to manage employees and track customers' interactions with the library.

## 🚀 Features
- **Book Management**: View book details such as title, category, author, publisher, and availability.
- **Employee Management**: List all employees, their positions, and salaries.
- **Customer Management**: Register new customers and track their activities.
- **Issue & Return Tracking**: Record book issuance and returns to ensure efficient tracking.
- **Custom Queries**: Generate reports like total book counts, customer data based on specific criteria, and more.

## 🗂 Project Structure
- **`SQL_Scripts/`**: Contains all SQL scripts used for database creation, data insertion, and queries.
- **`Screenshots/`**: Folder with screenshots showing the output of each query.
- **`README.md`**: Project description and guide for setup and usage.

## 📜 How to Use This Project

### Step 1: Setup the Database
1. Run the `database_creation.sql` file to create the `library` database and all necessary tables.
2. Populate the tables with the sample data provided in the `data_insertion.sql` file (optional).

### Step 2: Execute Queries
1. Run each query from the `queries.sql` file in your SQL client.
